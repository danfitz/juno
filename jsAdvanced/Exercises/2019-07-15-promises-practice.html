		/* Exercise 1 - Create your own Promise */

			// a. Use the promise constructor to write a promise and store it in a variable called `myPromise`. Remember that the constructor takes in a callback function as an argument. The callback function itself takes in 2 arguments: functions called `resolve` and `reject`.
			const myPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {

				// b. Write a setTimeout that will call `resolve` pass it the string "I've been fulfilled" as it's argument. Make this run after 2 seconds. 
				setTimeout(function() {
					resolve("I've been fulfilled");
				}, 2000);

				// c. Write a setTimeout that will call `reject` pass it the string "I was rejected" as it's argument, Make this run after 4 seconds.
				setTimeout(function() {
					reject("I was rejected");
				}, 4000);
			});
		
			// d. Console.log your promise to see what the promise object you just created looks like when you load the page
			console.log(myPromise);

			// e. Wait however long you set in your timeout and console.log `myPromise` again to see what has changed
			setTimeout(function() {
				console.log(myPromise);
			}, 2000);

			// f. Change the timeouts to have the reject function called after 2 seconds and the resolve function called after 4 seconds. Repeat steps d. and e. to see the difference in your promise object
	

		/* Exercise 2 - Handle promise results

			Handle the results of the promise you created and stored in `myPromise`. Use promise methods to chain handlers to your promise that console.log the result.

			Run your code and watch your console to see what happens!
		*/
		myPromise
			.then(function(response) {
				console.log(response);
			})
			.catch(function(err) {
				console.error(err);
			});

	

		/* Exercise 3 - Using Async & Await

			a. Write a function called `getGitHubDetails` using the async & await keywords to indicate that it handles some asynchronous actions. It should take one argument: a GitHub user name. 

			b. Use this argument to make a request to get data about that user from the GitHub API (https://api.github.com/users/<username>). If you use fetch to make the request don't forget to extract the response JSON using the .json() method! Console.log the user data.

			c. The user data you get back from the previous request should have a key on it called `repos_url`. Use that url to create another AJAX request to get all of that users' repos. Console.log the repo data.

			Don't forget to call your function!

		*/
		async function getGitHubDetails(username) {
			const usernameResponse = await $.ajax(`https://api.github.com/users/${username}`);
			console.log(usernameResponse);

			const userReposResponse = await $.ajax(usernameResponse.repos_url);
			console.log(userReposResponse);

			renderUserRepos(userReposResponse);
		}

		getGitHubDetails("danielfitz");
		

		// BONUS: Write another function that you can call once you get all of the data you need in `getGitHubDetails`. Call it `renderUserRepos`. It should take an argument which is an array of github repos. Loop through the array and build html to show each repo name and a link to the repository (HINT: use the `html_url` key).
		function renderUserRepos(repos) {

			repos.forEach(function(repo) {
				$(".repos").append(`
					<li class="repo"><a href="${repo.html_url}">${repo.name}</a></li>
				`);
			});
		}


		// Keep going - add on as much or as little data to your html as you want!
