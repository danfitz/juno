    <p>I'm interested in design, development, and business. I've been very fortunate to be able to do all three as a career.</p>

    <p>From a technical standpoint, I spend most of my time working with JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5, and React.js. For over 5 years, my title has been (junior, intermediate, and now senior) front-end developer. During the past year I have been working with NodeJS and SVG animations. New and open source web technologies make me super excited and I can't wait to see what's new for the web in the next few years.</p>

    <p>I learn from the community and love to share what I have learned.</p>
