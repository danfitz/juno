		<h1>Wine Time O'Clock</h1>
		<p>Sit and intelligently sip a glass. Monks and monasteries of the Roman Catholic Church have had an important influence on the history of Burgundy wine. Cork it! Winemakers refer to screw caps as Stelvin enclosures, because it sounds better than "lid." In cooler climates, cabernet sauvignon tends to produce wines with blackcurrant notes that can be accompanied by green bell pepper notes, mint and cedar which will all become more pronounced as the wine ages. A mommy needs more wine than adolescents. At sea, brutes have raided wine barrels.

		<p>A botrytized wine is made using grapes that have been allowed to become mouldy. Amaron is made primarily from Corvina grapes dried on racks before pressing. Decantering opens the wine through aeration, allowing the wine to display its full range. Pertinent info is found on the label. Trichloroanisole, or stinky cork, is produced when chlorine used in sanitization comes into contact with natural cork-dwelling bacteria. Sommelier is an elegant euphemism for professional wino. 
		</p>
		<p>The actual color of the wine can range from violet, typical of young wines, through red for mature wines, to brown for older red wines. Pursing your lips and inhaling some air while the wine is still on your palate is also a nice way to spread the more complex flavors through your sinuses. A toast to one's health originated in Greece – it meant "I'm not trying to kill you." The principal acid in wine is tartaric acid. High-end corks are handmade. Wine grapes grow almost exclusively between 30 and 50 degrees latitude north and south of the equator. The cabernet grape variety thrives in a variety of vineyard soil types. </p>

		<blockquote>The best wines impart a lingering, complex and rich finish. Young red wines may require several hours to aerate – if there's still any left. Delicacy is prized in pinot noir and riesling.</blockquote> 
		<p>Some whites age better in stainless steel. The concept of foie gras begs a brash blanc. The proper way to hold a wineglass is to position it so that the wine goes into your mouth. Dry yet sweet whites complement fish, chicken and pork dishes. Loamy soils, which are usually preferred for growing most plants, actually produce rather flavorless wines. </p>
