## Resume

Sections of a resume:

1. **Profile** - short and sweet, quickly says who you are, catches employer's attention
2. **Contact Info** - should be front and center and easy to find
3. **Education** - make sure to include hackerYou
4. **Skills** - 
5. **Work Experience**
6. **Volunteer Experience** - can include mentoring for hackerYou or CLC
7. **Portfolio** - link to portfolio!

### Profile & contact info

Your "About Me" should be consistent across all platforms! (Edit for length if you need to.) **You are cultivating a brand!**

Tips:
* Find your **story**! You're going to need to explain why you transitioned from your old career to this new one. Here's where you utilize your unique experiences to differentiate yourself.
* Make your words **actionable**! "I'm currently learning X" is always better than "I'm eager to learn". Think about the things you're doing and the things you want to be doing.
* Make sure contact info is easy to *find* and *read*.
* Include Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, portfolio, phone number, email, etc.

### Education & skills

You can say **Web Development Immersive Certificate, Juno College of Technology** as your education. Make sure to mention that Juno is a registered private career college. The school is held to standards by the government.

Skills to include:
* HTML5, CSS3, Sass
* Web accessibility requirements
* JavaScript fundamentals
* jQuery
* React
* Working with APIs
* Firebase
* Version control and collaboration using git and GitHub
* Modern text editors, snippets, Emmet
* Paired programming & team-based development
* Project scope management
* Best practices for modern web development

### Experience

Think **relevant and recent**!  Don't include anything older than 5 years if possible.

Tips:
* Don't fall into the trap of listing your job duties. Use the **STAR method**: situation, task, action, result.
* Keep your bullet points to 2-3.
* Use metrics: amount of improvement, number of people managed, etc.
* Be specific: what technologies did you use? How were you held accountable by metrics? How did you perform?
* Even if experience isn't relevant, include it to demonstrate longevity, any promotions, or leadership positions!

### Resume requirements

* PDF format only
* Make sure your resume is branded similarly to portfolio!
* Smaller than 1MB
* Must be only 1 page
* Naming convention: dan-fitz-resume.pdf
* Due Tuesday 10AM!
* Proofread! Have a friend proofread too!
* DON'T INCLUDE YOUR PHOTO. It distracts the employer.
* Make sure resume can be easily read from left to right.

Random tip: Use jargony tech words to describe the tools you used! For example, use "internal CMS" to describe Opterus.

Another random tip: You can cheat the timeline by breaking your experience into **Relevant Experience** and **Additional Experience**.

## Cover Letters

Cover letter structure:
* Should be about 1/2 page
* Start your cover letter with a **personal greeting**!
  * To find out who is hiring, check the job posting! If the job posting doesn't say, take a guess and address that person. It could be a tech lead (for medium company), CTO (for small company), HR person (for big company)
  * Even if it's not the right person, it demonstrates that you did your **research**.
* First paragraph - Who are you? Why are you interested in this company? What makes the company special to you?
* Second paragraph - What specifically makes you a good fit? What technical and soft skills do you have that align with the position? What are you learning/working on that aligns?
  * Be specific to what's included in the job requirements.
  * Literally copy their words!
* Third paragraph - What soft skills do you bring to the table? What sets you apart?

1. Personal greeting
2. Why you're interested in the role and company
3. Why you're a good fit
4. What else you bring to the table that's valuable

### Common cover letter mistakes

* Too generic!
  * Cover letters should be specific to each application--especially the first paragraph!
* No greeting
* Not enough about you
  * Be confident and hype up your skills!
* Too boring!
  * Being a newbie makes you super enthusiastic! Show that enthusiasm!
  * Feel free to be informal. (Unless you're applying to huge companies.)
* No action items
  * You need a call to action! Make it easy for the employer to know what to do next!

## Job Seeker

**GOAL**: 2 quality job applications per day from Monday to Friday

### General job seeking rules

* The people who get the phone call first are usually the ones that perfectly fit the job requirements, so be patient!
* Signed offers are firm, so don't bail because it could bite you in the ass later.
* Sometimes there are things beyond your control, so be gentle with yourself. Don't be so hard on yourself. (For example, someone can get hired because they have a unique skill that you don't have.)

### Job seeking mistakes

* Not taking breaks (mental health comes first!)
* Not coding every day
* Not following up on applications (following up can really push or remind employers to consider you)
* Not applying to jobs that seem above you (the only guaranteed no is to not apply at all)
* Not applying to a variety of jobs (you can have an industry or company goal, but apply to other companies too!)

### Resume & LinkedIn tips

Make your "About Me" consistent across your LinkedIn, resume, and portfolio.

Difference between LinkedIn and resume: resume is everything **relevant** to the job, while LinkedIn allows you to put **everything** that matters.

Focus on your LinkedIn *first*. For example. when searching for potential employees, the ones that show up first are the ones who *followed* the company.

Hone in on your previous experiences into 2-3 bullet points each. Focus on the absolute essentials.

Looking to describe what Juno is on LinkedIn? Here's a starting point:
* See slides

### The job hunt

When Chi-Chi says "cover letter", she just means a verbose warm email. It's a callout to a hiring manager to help push you up the consideration pile. (You're NOT putting the cover letter as an attachment. It's in the body of the email.)

If your job posting just says "Upload Resume", DO NOT upload a cover letter. **Follow the instructions** because those instructions are the hiring manager's preferences.

Do your research on the company. Follow their social media. Find out their culture and what they do. Find out awards they've won. Find out their mission and goals! The goal is to show enthusiasm and interest!

Match the tone of the company's website and social media. You don't want to sound too stuffy (for hip companies) or too weird (for conservative companies).

DO NOT LIE. Tell the truth. You *can* say what you're learning though! It could even be things you're learning that are not code-related--like a new language!

Make sure the cover letter email has a signature with working relevant links to your brand!

### Finding contact email

Tips:
* Sometimes the hiring email is in the About Me on LinkedIn.
* Other times you can find out the email pattern (e.g. firstname.lastname@company.com) and blind email the relevant person based on their name.

DO NOT spend hours looking for an email. It's not worth your time.

### Thank you note

The purpose of the thank you note is to actually **sell yourself more**. "Thanks for meeting me... Here's all these other things I'm excited about and can bring to the table!"

### Job hunting tips

You're leaving a structured environment and entering a structured one. **Create some structure**. (You can come to Juno until you're employed!)

Your schedule:

1. Apply to 2-4 jobs per day. This should take you about 4 hours. Stop.
2. Use your spreadsheet to track everything.
3. When you're done your applications, code for 4 hours. Stop and do something else.

**Important**: One-on-ones are available to you at any time. Just slack!

**Things to note**:
* Keep your pipeline full. Even if you're getting close to one opportunity, keep applying to other jobs!
* Don't be too picky. Apply to jobs even if they're just meh. The most important thing is to get "developer" on your resume.
* Contracts are just *fine*! They are sometimes the way that companies vet you!

Checkpoints:
1. When you've completed 40 applications or hit the 1 month mark, you will have to do a one-on-one.

### Tools

### Interviews

If you do 3 interviews and get no offers, go to Chi-Chi to try some mock interviews to improve your interview skills!

Be prepared to state your salary expectations, so know your range.

Things to remember:
* Bring your laptop
* Always follow up with a thank you note the same day. A written thank you is actually a nice touch!
* Turn off your phone
* Bring a printed out list of questions with the *company logo on top*!
* Follow up once a week until you get an answer or feel creepy

### Offers

* Always get a written offer.
* Don't turn any offer down until you speak to Chi-Chi first. Sometimes you can negotiate an offer to make it better.
