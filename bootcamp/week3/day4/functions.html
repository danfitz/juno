      // 7. Write a function `greaterThanThree(n)` which logs "Yes" to the console if a n is greater than three. *Hint:* You will need to use the `>` comparison operator and a conditional statement inside your function.
      const greaterThanThree = function(n) {
        if (n > 3) {
          console.log("Yes");
