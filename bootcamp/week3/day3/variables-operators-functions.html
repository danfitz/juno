// STEP 1:
// Assign your name, age, and a random fact about you to variables
// Create a string that describes you:
// "My name is ---. I am --- years old. Something you may not know about me is that -----."
// Print the string to the console
const myName = "Dan";
let myAge = 27;
const myRandomFact = "I don't have any toes";
const myString = `My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old. Something you may not know about me is that ${myRandomFact}.`;

console.log(myString);


// STEP 2:
// Tomorrow is your birthday! YAY! Use an operator to print a string to the console that says "Tomorrow I will be ---- years old"?
// Can you think of multiple ways you could do this? What are the implications of each?
console.log(`Tomorrow I will be ${myAge = myAge + 1} years old!`);
console.log(myAge);

// STEP 3:
// When a user comes to the page, ask them for their name, age, and random fact then save those to variables and print them out as well. (HINT: What is a built in window method to get user input from the browser?)
const userName = prompt("What is your name?");
const userAge = prompt("What is your age?");
const userRandomFact = prompt("Tell us something random about yourself");
const userString = `Nice to meet you, ${userName}! For a ${userAge} year old, you're looking good! Wow! You ${userRandomFact}? Me too!`;

console.log(userString);
