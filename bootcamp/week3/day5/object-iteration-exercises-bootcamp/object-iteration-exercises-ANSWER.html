			oranges: 3,
			bananas: 6,
			milk: 2

		//1. Print a string that looks like this:

		console.log(`We have ${inventory.apples} apples, ${inventory.oranges} oranges, ${inventory.bananas} bananas, and ${inventory.milk} cartons of milk in stock.`)

		}
		// There are 2 apples.
		// There are 3 oranges.
		// There are 6 bananas.

		//2d. Write a control flow statement that finds out if the store is open. If it is, console log "Welcome!". If not, console log "Come back tomorrow!"

		const checkIfOpen = function(value){
			if(value === true){
				console.log("Welcome!")
			} else if (value === false){
				console.log("Come back tomorrow!")
			}
		}

        //2f. Run the checkIfOpen function in the console. Check if the output matches what you would expect given that outdoorStore.open is currently false.

		// 2g. Change the value of outdoorStore.open and verify that checkIfOpen runs correctly.
