## Why Design Matters

You may not be doing the design yourself, but you will be working with designers. Therefore, having a broad understanding will only help you.

## Design Checklist

1. Has the viewport area of the site been optimized?

Examples:
* Short viewport with whitespace below
* Unnecessary scroll space

2. Are all elements of the site arranged in a grid system?

Items should line up with each other. It makes everything look more **cohesive**.

3. Is there sufficient whitespace around the site?

Whitespace provides visual relief.

4. Are the fonts used appropriate for the site?

**Sans serif** is best for body text because it's easier to read on a screen. Keep interesting or elaborate fonts for headings. The extra size allows you to get away with fonts that are harder to read.

**Pro tip**: [Font Pair](https://fontpair.co) shows you nice font pairings.

Just make sure that your fonts fit the content of the site to fit the mood, energy, brand, etc.

Useful categories:
* Classic
* Artistic
* Alternative
* Modern

5. Are your fonts readable?

Some things that affect readability:
* Color ratio
* Font size
* Line height
  * Too little makes text hard to read and too much makes lines look like separate paragraphs
  * Default HTML is 1.2
  * Good line height starting point is 1.6
* Letter spacing
* Text alignment
  * Center and right alignment are bad for reading long text because the starting point of each lines varies, making for awkward adjustment at each new line
  * Justification is bad when some lines are too sparse, so it creates awkward gaps

6. Is the size of the text varied to create hierarchy?

Think about the information you're displaying and its importance and *then* size accordingly.

7. Colour scheme

You only need to know where to find a colour scheme, not how to come up with one.

Resources:
* [coolors](https://coolors.co)
* [colordot](https://color.hailpixel.com)
* [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)

Simple trick:
* White or light gray (#FAFAFA) background
* Black or dark gray (#232323) text
* Then just pick 3 more colours

Colour categories:
* Main colour: the base (backgrounds, headings)
* Secondary colour: supporting colour for visual interest (backgrounds, headings, etc.)
* Accent colour: calls to action that draw attention (links, buttons, etc.)
* ????

8. Are elements on your site consistent?

Just make sure everything you use stays consistent: border radius, shadows, borders, buttons, etc.

9. Are the icons throughout the site cohesive with one another?

Icons should look like they're part of the same set. This includes consistency in colour, size, treatment.

10. Are images throughout the site strong and cohesive?

* Choose high-quality images because pixelated images look unprofessional
* Make sure your images are relevant to your content!

**Pro tip**: Add an **colour overlay** when you want to add cohesiveness to images that don't initially match.

Image resources:
* Pexels
* Split Shire

11. Is it immediately clear what the purpose of the site is?

Does the user know what actions they should make? (Scroll, click, read, etc.) Is there a clear reason why users would want to give you their personal information?

12. Are pseudo states used?

Pseudo states give the user feedback like when you hover over an element and then click on it. It communicates the ability to interact.

13. Are animations purposeful and not overwhelming?

Animations should be subtle and enhance user experience. They shouldn't take away from content that's important.

14. Is the site design optimized for all screen sizes?

Show people that you've thought about the user experience at every size.

Common Issues:
* Don't have horizontal scroll
* No huge gaps
* On smaller screens, remove animations or smooth scrolls that harm user experience

15. Are the sections of the site laid out logically and interestingly?

Tips:
* Think about your first impression at the top.
* Alternate your sections with colours, number of elements, etc.

**Pro tip**: Stat with wireframes for both desktop and mobile.

16. Is there something that makes the site visually interesting?

You want your project or portfolio to be striking or memorable. This can be a colour, image, animation, etc. The goal is **memorability** and **injecting your personality**.
