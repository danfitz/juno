## How to Read Application

Listen to what it says.

Take note if it says:
* Team/hiring manager's name
* 

## Process

1. Apply online. Read the instructions and do what's told of you (see above).
2. Send a cover letter introducing yourself to the hiring manager/recruiter saying things like...
  * I just applied and wanted to introduce myself
  * Here's everything about me that is great to know!
3. Follow up 5-7 days later over and over.

**Note**: If you don't get a response, on the third follow-up, ask for the contact info of the relevant person, so you can actually get a response.

## Evaluation

Some tips:
* Note down what's going on in your interviews. It gives you a hint of how you can prepare better in the future, if any interview doesn't go well.
