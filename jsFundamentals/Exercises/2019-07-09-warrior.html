        // equipment, a string with the value "shield".
        // energy, defaults to the number 100.
        // location, an object with two properties: x and y. The values of x and y are numeric.
        // a method walk() which updates the warrior's location. If the warrior's location is x:10 and y:5 then walk(2, 0) will update the location to x:12 and y:5.
